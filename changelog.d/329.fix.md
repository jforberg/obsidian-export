Support markdown formatting in wikilinks

Previously, links with formatting such as bold or italics (like `[[Note|Example **bold** and *italic* link text]]`) were not accounted for correctly, resulting in such links being rendered as literal text instead.
Now these will parse correctly and render actual links as intended.
