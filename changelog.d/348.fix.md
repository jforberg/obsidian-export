Fix `--preserve-mtime` error when files are skipped by postprocessors

When `--preserve-mtime` is enabled and files are skipped by postprocessors (e.g., due to `--skip-tags`), the exporter would attempt to set the modification time on non-existent destination files, causing an error.

Now this no longer happens because the exporter won't attempt to set an mtime when postprocessors caused files to be skipped.
